# CompensatoryIndels
Code for Compensatory Indels

This code is being used for an ongoing research project at the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities, under the direction of Professor Yaniv Brandvain.

Most of the code being used is just for manipulating and filtering some original data, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Gregor-Mendel-Institute/swedish-genomes).

This will be updated somewhat regularly by the author. All code (with explanation), as well as references to relevant papers, will be in the python notebook file "Project_Notebook". Original python code files can be given as requested, but a simple copy-paste (or just downloading the notebook in its entirety) should be sufficient for most purposes.
