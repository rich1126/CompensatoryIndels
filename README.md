# CompensatoryIndels
Code for Compensatory Indels

This code is being used for an ongoing research project at the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities, under the direction of Professor Yaniv Brandvain.

Most of the code being used is just for manipulating and filtering some original data, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Gregor-Mendel-Institute/swedish-genomes).

This will be updated somewhat regularly by the author, however the main references will be in a python notebook file.
